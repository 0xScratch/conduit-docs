# Run an Arbitrum Orbit node

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  At this time, Conduit cannot offer support for self-hosted nodes. If you need
  support, consider using [Conduit Nodes](https://conduit.xyz/nodes), the
  managed version of nodes for your RPC needs, including autoscaling, backups,
  monitoring, automatic fork support, and much more.
</Callout>

To run a self-hosted node for an Arbitrum rollup deployed on Conduit, please follow the steps below to configure the necessary settings and gather all required information. Afterwards, you can proceed with [Arbitrum's documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-an-orbit-node) on how to run a node.

<Steps>
### Sign In
Log in to the [Conduit app](https://app.conduit.xyz).
 
### Access Settings
Navigate to your deployment dashboard. Click on `Settings`, then select `General` from the sidebar.

### Enable external Nodes

Activate the `Enable external nodes` setting. **Note**: If you wish to disable this setting later, please contact our [Support](https://portal.usepylon.com/conduit-xyz/forms/support-request).

### Gather required Information from the Deployment Dashboard

Navigate to the Deployment Dashboard. Go to the `Overview` section and click the `Run a Node` button on the right side.

#### Sequencer Feed Relay Endpoint
