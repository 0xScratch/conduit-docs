# Run an OP Stack node

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  At this time, Conduit cannot offer support for self-hosted nodes. If you need
  support, consider using [Conduit Nodes](https://conduit.xyz/nodes), the
  managed version of nodes for your RPC needs, including autoscaling, backups,
  monitoring, automatic fork support, and much more.
</Callout>

To run a self-hosted node for an OP Stack rollup deployed on Conduit, please follow the steps below to configure the necessary settings and gather all required information. Afterwards, you can proceed with [Optimism's documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/tutorials/node-from-docker) on how to run a node.

<Steps>
### Sign In
Log in to the [Conduit app](https://app.conduit.xyz).
 
### Access Settings
Navigate to your deployment dashboard. Click on `Settings`, then select `General` from the sidebar.

### Enable external Nodes

Activate the `Enable external nodes` setting. **Note**: If you wish to disable this setting later, please contact our [Support](https://portal.usepylon.com/conduit-xyz/forms/support-request).

### Gather required Information from the Deployment Dashboard

Navigate to the Deployment Dashboard. Go to the `Overview` section and click the `Run a Node` button on the right side.

#### Access Configuration Files

The popup will provide the `rollup.json` and `genesis.json` files.

#### P2P Configuration

You will find the values for `OP_NODE_P2P_BOOTNODES` and `OP_NODE_P2P_STATIC` in the same popup.

**Additional Settings:** Consider setting `OP_NODE_P2P_SYNC_ONLYREQTOSTATIC` to `true` if network reliability is a concern, especially when dealing with networks that may have unreliable peers. This setting ensures more consistent and stable synchronization by forcing the node to request sync data only from `OP_NODE_P2P_STATIC`.

#### Submitting Transactions to your Node (if required)

If you plan to submit transactions to your node, set the `public RPC URL` of your network as the `OP_GETH_SEQUENCER_HTTP`. For production usage, you can generate an API Key via [Conduit Nodes](https://conduit.xyz/nodes). You can find the `public RPC URL` in the dashboard.

### Next Steps

You should now have all the information about your Rollup that is needed to run your own self-hosted node. Follow [Optimism's documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/tutorials/node-from-docker) for the next Steps.

</Steps>

## Monitoring Sync Progress

Run [`optimism_syncStatus`](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/json-rpc#optimism_syncstatus) to check the current sync status of your node. From the output, note the block number associated with the sync status. Search for this block number on your block explorer to determine when it was processed on our end. By comparing the block's processing time, you can estimate how far behind your node is in the synchronization process.
