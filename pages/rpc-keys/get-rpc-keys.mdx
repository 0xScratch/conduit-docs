# Get a RPC Key

The same way you might use platforms like Alchemy or Infura to access Ethereum, you can use our endpoints to send requests to the built-in RPCs on Conduit chains. 

**To do this you'll need to get an RPC key.**

## Steps

<Steps>

### Sign up or log in to [Conduit](https://app.conduit.xyz/)

### Head to the [RPC Keys](https://app.conduit.xyz/rpc-keys) page

### Click `Create new key` and name your key

### Activate the endpoints you would like to access

### Copy the RPC or WSS URL and your access key string

### Start sending requests to the Conduit rollup RPC endpoint

</Steps>
