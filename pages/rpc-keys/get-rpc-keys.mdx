# Get an RPC Key

The same way you might use platforms like Alchemy or Infura to access Ethereum, you can use our endpoints to send requests to the built-in RPCs on Conduit chains. 

**To do this you'll need to get an RPC key.**

1. Sign up or log in to [Conduit](https://app.conduit.xyz/)
2. Head to the [RPC Keys](https://app.conduit.xyz/rpc-keys) page
4. Click “Create new key” and name your key
5. Activate the endpoints you would like to access
5. Copy the RPC or WSS URL and your access key string
6. Start sending requests to the Conduit rollup RPC endpoint
