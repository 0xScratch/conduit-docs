#### What's the difference between a public and private rollup?

When your rollup is set as public it's discoverable in the Conduit app. This means that it's published on pages such as [Browse rollups](https://app.conduit.xyz/browse-networks) and [Nodes](https://app.conduit.xyz/nodes), which anyone with a Conduit account outside of your organization can access. Also, a [public URL](https://app.conduit.xyz/published/view/zora-mainnet-0) is generated for your rollup where its network information and tooling can be found.

All rollups are set as private by default. Private rollups are not discoverable or visible anywhere in the Conduit app except to your own organization. However, it still remains a live, publicly viewable blockchain.

#### What's a verified rollup?

Since rollup deployment is permissionless and their names, icons, or IDs aren't always unique, we've introduced a small feature in the UI which we call verification. All that means is that we have manually verified the rollup and its owner are authentic. Anyone can request us to verify their rollup by [submitting a request](https://conduitxyz.typeform.com/to/UYTp17YT). We typically only verify popular chains in an effort to protect people from malicious rollups imitating legitimate rollups (we've yet to see this happen but verification is there as a precaution).

#### How do I cancel a testnet or mainnet subscription plan?

Deleting your testnet or mainnet rollup automatically cancels the subscription associated with that deployment. You can delete your rollup from Settings > General in your deployment dashboard.

#### Why is contract verification failing when I deploy using `CREATE2`, and how can I resolve it?

Deploying a contract with `CREATE2` generates a deterministic address through an internal transaction, ensuring the same address is created regardless of the deployment's origin. Internal indexing is highly resource-intensive. As a result, we've disabled internal transaction indexing in Blockscout, meaning contracts deployed via `CREATE2` wonâ€™t be automatically indexed.

To resolve this, simply visit the contract address after deployment. Blockscout will fetch the contract from the RPC, recognize it, and allow verification to proceed. If needed, we can enable internal transaction indexing, but this would involve discussing pricing implications due to increased costs associated with higher growth.

#### Why do I see a "This is a potential scam" warning when adding my network to MetaMask?

MetaMask shows this warning when a network's ChainID isn't recognized or verified. MetaMask pulls ChainIDs from a community-maintained repository on GitHub: [Ethereum-Lists](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains). To resolve this, you can submit a PR to add your network's ChainID to the list.
