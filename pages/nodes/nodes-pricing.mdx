### Autoscaling

Paid plans autoscale at $0.10/1M CUs once the base CU limit has been reached. e.g. When on the Pro Plan, once your org has consumed the 1B CU base limit included in your plan, every additional 1M CUs will cost $0.10. You can add a spend limit in settings, which allows you to control the maximum amount that can be spent each month.
