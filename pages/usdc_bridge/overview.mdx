# Bridged USDC - Overview

The Bridged USDC integration adheres to Circle's [Bridged USDC Standard](https://www.circle.com/en/bridged-usdc) for deploying bridged USDC onto your rollup. This integration offers several key benefits:

- **Secure and Audited**: Leverages the same trusted and audited code that has been deployed across numerous mainnets.
- **Seamless Upgrade Path**: Allows for a smooth transition to native USDC at a later date, eliminating the need for time-consuming migrations and providing developers and users immediate access to native USDC when available.

In this section, you will also learn how to avoid liquidity fragmentation and ensure a streamlined transition to native USDC while bridging onto your rollup.

## Upgrade to Native USDC

If the official USDC bridge from the Conduit Marketplace is used, you and Circle have the option to agree to upgrade to a native version of USDC at a later date. Having native USDC available on your rollup has the following benefits:

- Issuance is handled by Circle, a regulated fintech
- Fully reserved and redeemable 1:1 for US Dollars, instead of being backed by USDC on your rollup’s settlement layer
- Becomes the “official” form of USDC for your rollup, reducing liquidity fragmentation
- USDC can be bridged to all supported blockchain networks that are integrated with CCTP directly without withdrawing to the settlement layer

Therefore, we recommend using the official USDC bridge integration instead of third-party offerings.

## Note for OP-Stacks

When installing the Bridged USDC Integration from the Conduit Marketplace on your Rollup, it's important to avoid having USDC liquidity split across different bridges. This can happen if the same asset is bridged with multiple bridge contracts, creating different versions of the token on your rollup.

1. If you're using SuperBridge or another bridge provider, it's a good idea to contact their support to have your new USDC bridge address added to their UI.

2. After deploying your new USDC bridge, update any related contracts and user interfaces to ensure users are interacting with the correct bridge.
