# Bridge USDC to your OP Stack Rollup

This guide will show you how to manually bridge USDC to your rollup using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) CLI commands.

## Depositing

On the settlement layer, execute the following steps to bridge USDC to your rollup:

<Steps>
### Locate Bridge Contracts

In the Conduit UI, navigate to the `Apps` section. Click on `Your Apps` and select `Bridged USDC`. Youâ€™ll find the `Installation Details` in the bottom-right corner, including contract addresses for:

- `Bridged USDC (Rollup)`
- `USDC (Settlement Layer)
- `Bridge (Rollup)`
- `Bridge (Settlement Layer)`
- `Rollup Factory (Rollup)`

Export these addresses as environment variables:

```bash copy
export ROLLUP_USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=<Bridged USDC>
```

```bash copy
export ROLLUP_USDC_BRIDGE_ADDRESS=<Bridge (Rollup)>
```

```bash copy
export SETTLEMENT_USDC_BRIDGE_ADDRESS=<Bridge (Settlement Layer)>
```

### Settlement Layer USDC Addresses & Settlement RPC URL

Pick your settlement layer and export the Settlement USDC Token Address and the RPC URL as environment variables:

| Settlement Layer | SETTLEMENT_USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Ethereum Mainnet | `0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48` |
| Sepolia Testnet  | `0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238` |
| Arbitrum         | `0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831` |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | `0x75faf114eafb1BDbe2F0316DF893fd58CE46AA4d` |
| Base             | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` |
| Base Sepolia     | `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` |

```bash copy
export SETTLEMENT_USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x....
```

```bash copy
export SETTLEMENT_RPC_URL=https://...
```

### Configure Foundry with your wallet

We need to sign the transactions with a private key. Refer to [Foundry's Key Management Best Practices](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/best-practices?highlight=ledger#private-key-management) for production use.

The following steps will utilize the `--private-key` flag and the `$PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable. Set the environment variable with the following command:

```bash copy
export PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

If you're using a different method, replace `--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY` with the appropriate flag in the commands below.

### Fund your wallet

Make sure your wallet is funded with the native token and USDC on the settlement layer. If you are bridging onto a Testnet you can claim some testnet USDC here: [Circle Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/).

### Approve

Set the amount you want to bridge

```bash copy
export AMOUNT=100
```

Approve the Optimism bridge contract on the settlement layer to transfer your USDC:

```bash copy
cast send $SETTLEMENT_USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS "approve(address,uint256)" $SETTLEMENT_USDC_BRIDGE_ADDRESS $AMOUNT --rpc-url $SETTLEMENT_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Bridge

Bridge USDC to your rollup:

```bash copy
cast send $SETTLEMENT_USDC_BRIDGE_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address,uint256,uint32)" $(cast wallet address $PRIVATE_KEY) $AMOUNT 100000 --rpc-url $SETTLEMENT_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

</Steps>

## Withdrawing

After a few minutes, your deposit should be processed and available on your rollup. To withdraw USDC, follow these steps:

<Steps>
### Approve

Approve the rollup bridge contract to transfer your USDC:

```bash copy
cast send $ROLLUP_USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS "approve(address,uint256)" $ROLLUP_USDC_BRIDGE_ADDRESS $AMOUNT --rpc-url $ROLLUP_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Bridge

Send USDC from your rollup back to the Settlement Layer:

```bash copy
cast send $ROLLUP_USDC_BRIDGE_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address,uint256,uint32)" $(cast wallet address $PRIVATE_KEY) $AMOUNT 100000 --rpc-url $ROLLUP_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

</Steps>
