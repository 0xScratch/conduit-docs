# OP Stack

> Conduit allows you to launch a rollup in a fraction of the time with the OP Stack.

OP Stack is the premiere open-source rollup implementation. In their [Bedrock Explainer](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/explainer/) (the latest version of OP Stack) Optimism outlines the benefits of their modular stack. You get:

- **10-100x cheaper fees** than Ethereum Mainnet
- **Interoperability** with Mainnet through trustless bridging
- **Ethereum Equivalence**, so you can use the same workflows and tooling
- Improved node performance, so you can get **thousands of transactions per second**

Below is a great primer on how the OP Stack works to bring you more performance while maintaining security.

## FAQ

### How do I withdraw/bridge tokens?

Please see our guide of using the Conduit SDK alongside the Optimism SDK [here](https://github.com/conduit-xyz/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/cross-dom-bridge-eth).

### Are there any public audits?

Optimism audits can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/docs/security-reviews). Optimism has a [security framework](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/security/faq) to support the continuous development they do time by time.
